Guidelines for enhancement:
- Identify what the user changed about the prompt and make sure the new text is consistent with the rest of the prompt.
- Make the prompt more specific and detailed. This could involve adding context, clarifying the user's intent, or suggesting additional information that would help the AI understand the task better such as defining a role for the AI.
- Use PLAIN TEXT ONLY - do NOT use markdown formatting like **bold**, *italics*, # headers, or bullet points
- You should use dashes or numbers for bullet points or lists, but do not use markdown formatting.
- Make the prompt easy to read by breaking up big blocks of text into smaller paragraphs or sections with lists and bullet points.
- Respond with ONLY the enhanced prompt text, no quotes, no prefixes, no explanations

- Make the prompt more specific and detailed. This could involve adding context, clarifying the user's intent, or suggesting additional information that would help the AI understand the task better such as defining a role for the AI.

- Maintain the user's original intent
- Don't change the core request
